# LogMeIn-Scraper

This program runs using Puppeteer, which uses J-Node. The point of this program is to load up LogMeIn Rescue's Command Center webpage and pull data from it. This particular program reads off the "Green" and "Red" numbers from the page, which correspond to the number of "Available" Technicians and the number of "Missed" Chats. This program was used during my time at Continuum Managed Services and was meant to mimic live data.
